# It provides the following services: 
# 	- Starting crond
# 	- Displaying the latest image of mars (with 30 second delay for wpa_supplicant to connect)
# 	- Syncing the system and hardware clocks
# Once the above is complete, the script disables Wi-Fi and suspends teh system to save power.

# Start crond with the correct working directory and logfile.
